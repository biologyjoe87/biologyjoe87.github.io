I am a first-year Population Biology PhD Student at the University of California, Davis. I am a member of the Dynamics of Ecological and Evolutionary Processes (DEEP) Lab, led by Sebastian Schreiber. 

I completed my undergraduate education at the College of Charleston Honors College in 2022 with a B.S. in Mathematics and B.A. in Biology. In the Fall of 2022, I began my PhD at the University of California, Davis in Population Biology. 

My current research interests lie in understanding processes in community ecology and conservation biology using mathematical and computational methods. I enjoy thinking about topics like community assembly, Modern Coexistence Theory, and Community Viability Analysis using mathematical methods such as dynamical systems, stochastic processes, and network science.
